dupe nuker not working, but non-essential
0000-00-00 is no longer a valid sql date
No friends of citr image upload found
Ad scheduler goes in endless loop if it can't find a SAM category
Ad scheduler and SAM integration is very tightly coupled - one shouldn't be enabled without the other the way the code is written
Same with SAM Ad History - should be disabled if SAM integration is off
Socan Period needs to move to API - some functions still depend on socan handler
Track artist and composer needs to do something if null/none
Fix listener that pauses a song when you hit play on another

CAPSTONE
=====================================

If you aren't logged in, return "please log in" for most submissions routes
album art big on review after submitting review
submit to library actually moves files from submissions upload
editing lib moves files
upload mp3 and images for library pages
samscan
djland scan
testing
delete button on submit online instead of checkbox
Generate new digital submissons - Generate email format & handle null case
Generate new digital submissons - remove double title bar
Submit online needs better email - use proper laravel template
Manual submission should not require email? Maybe
shift select for bulk editing
check that navigating away while shit is uploading is warned and how well it still works
Searching past submissions shouldn't require date?
Singles tables
Tagging:alter song name, credit, track number, performer?
Keep genres and subgenres as id number throughout lib and submissions.
    Setup trigger for deletion: warning when you delete a genre/subgenre for how many
    tracks will go untagged.
Library search by subgenre. Display subgenre. Make sure the subgenre gets written to lib
The deleted table generally looks bad
